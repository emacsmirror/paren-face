* Faces for parentheses and/or brackets

Three libraries are being maintained in this repository, each of which
defines a face to be used for parentheses and/or brackets.  While they
are maintained in the same repository, each library is distributed on
Melpa as a separate package.

*** ~paren-face~

This library implements a single face, which was originally only used
for parentheses.  Nowadays the same face is also used for brackets, by
default.  While it is possible to go back to using the face just for
parentheses, this package does not allow using a dedicated face just
for brackets.

I have considered updating this package to provide two separate faces,
but it quickly became clear that I would like to make further changes,
but those would break the expectations of existing users.

*** ~parenthesis-face~ and ~bracket-face~

Instead of heavily modifying ~paren-face~, I have implemented two new,
separate libraries/packages.  I am using two separate packages, so
that all the symbol names begin with the name of their package (as
one is supposed to do).

** Motivation

We Lispers probably don't need to be constantly made aware of the
existence of the parentheses.  Dimming them might be even more useful
for people new to Lisp, who have not yet learned to subconsciously
blend out the parentheses.
